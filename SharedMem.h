Semantics:

A Sharedmem object encapsulates a POSIX shared memory abstraction. This is achieved by using several system calls as there is no singel system call that directly can fulfill this task. Two or more processes can be attached to a shared memory segment in order to implement an IPC channel between them. A Sharedmem object serves as a wrapper to map a simple semantics and terminology to the underlying system call interface.


Usage:

A shared memory segment must be be allocated using a unique keyvalue. For related processes, parent-child, to share a memory segment the key IPC_PRIVATE is sufficient. For unrelated processes another unique key must be supplied. Some keyvalues are reserved by the system and cannot be used. The C-library function ftok(.....) provides one way of getting one. See man ftok.

A typical usage of the Sharedmem class in a parent-child scenario could be:

-	Parent allocates a shared memory segment:
	Sharedmem(IPC_PRIVATE,int)
		or
	Sharedmem() + allocate(key_t,int) later on

	NOTE that a Sharedmem object itself holds no shared memory, just some information about it.

-	Parent forks one or several new processes. Parent + children now have copies of the Sharedmem object i.e the same information about it.

-	Every forked child process that wishes to use the shared memory must attach it to the process using member attach(void). Unrelated processes must use attach(int) with the proper id as argument.

-	To access the shared memory a pointer of the right type is assigned the return value from member getAddr(void). The value must be cast to the right type before assignment.

-	The processes can now use the shared memory. It is quite obvious that the usage requires synchronization among the processes and a protocol how to communicate.

-	When a process is done with the shared memory it must detach it by using the member detach(void).

-	Eventually one of the processes returns the shared memory to the system by using the member remove(void). The Sharedmem object itself obeys the regular C++ rules for scope and lifetime.

Information about the usage of shared memory could be obtained from the command 'ipcs -m'. Hand-crafted removal can be done using the 'ipcrm -m  <id>' command.

NB you probably already have some shared memory segments allocated before you use this class. Run ipcs -m and check before you use it and note the ids in use so you won't destroy something that is not to be destroyed... Every new shared memory segments will probably get a higher id than those already present.
